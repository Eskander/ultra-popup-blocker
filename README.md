# Ultra Popup Blocker
Ultra Popup Blocker (or UPB for short) is a lightweight Popup Blocker that aims to *radically* block **all popup windows** by default, (even good, unharmful, user-initiated ones) while giving users control to allow popups temporarily or permanently via a whitelisting mechanism.
